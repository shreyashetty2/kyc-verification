**KYC DOCUMENT VERIFICATION WITH LIVE VIDEO**

We are moving towards completely digital onboarding of customers across various sectors. Most businesses need one or more of the customer documents to identify the authenticity of the customer. There are continued fraud reports about customers uploading documents of some third party, deceased individuals, etc. without their consent leading to forged accounts being opened. This problem can be resolved by digitally scanning all the documents (which are ways to validate the authenticity) such as PAN, Driving License, Passport, AADHAR, etc, extracting customer photos from the document and comparing them with images from a live 20/30-sec video. This will ensure that documents belong to the person uploading them. 

**OBJECTIVES:**
1. To perform Face Matching using Live Video and Government ID  proof
2. To check for Authentication of the ID proof provided
3. To reduce Manpower for KYC verification 
4. To build a more secure and transparent system of KYC verification.

**CONCLUSION**
1. Successful extraction of face from the document uploaded
2. Face of the person is successfully captured from the screenshot taken during the live video
3. On comparing the two faces in the images - results were displayed to find out if the verification was successful or not
4. Howerever, it was observed that precision for extraction of image from aadhar card is less.
5. Added one more layer of Verification through QR Code
